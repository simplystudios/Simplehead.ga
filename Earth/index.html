  Wadhwa  is a Clan who belong to

   Arora
   caste, a warrior tribe from the northern Indian subcontinent. Most of them are believed to be a part of 
  Khukhrain
   Katris. As administrators and rulers, Kshatriyas were assigned with protecting dharma, and serving humanity and the world. Over time, as a result of economic and political exigencies, the Khatri also expanded into other occupations. Wadhwa surname originally hailed from the areas of the Salt Range and particularly the town of Bhera in Punjab. This area was the Sind Sagar Doab (Indus-Jhelum interfluve) and the Jech Doab (Jhelum-Chenab interfluve) region of Pakistan that comprised Khushab, Pindi Gheb, Talagang, Chakwal, Pind Dadan Khan, Peshawar and Nowshera.
              Wadhwas are also associated with Khukhrain Arora group which are believed to have branched out of Sethi clan. Sethis are believed to be one of the bravest clans of Khatri's. The clan was developed as warriors and defenders of their land and they have also been in the civil, government, and military administration roles for centuries.They have also expanded into trade and mercantile businesses. Present day Khukhrain clans:- Anand, Kohli, Suri, Bhasin, Sahani, Chadha, Sethi, Sabharwal, Ghai, Chandhok, Chhachi, Gandhoke and Wadhwa (came into existence much later). Khukhrain's were one of the foremost followers of the Sikh Gurus, and traditionally brought up one son as a Keshdhari Sikh. This resulted in Khukhrain family names being present in both Hindu and Sikh communities worldwide.
   
  Khukhrain
             The Khukhrain are an ancient group of eight specific clans of the Khatri caste  who originally hailed from the areas of the Salt Range and particularly the town of Bhera in Punjab. This area was the Sind Sagar Doab (Indus-Jhelum interfluve) and the Jech Doab (Jhelum-Chenab interfluve) region of Pakistan that comprised Khushab, Pindi Gheb, Talagang, Chakwal, Pind Dadan Khan, Peshawar and Nowshera. The name "Doab" literally translates to "land of two rivers" ("Do" two, "Ab" river; Punjabi). In former India, Sind Sagar Doab and Jech Doab were the main region where Khukrains were in large number. The language spoken in the region was majorly Doabi. The names of the eight clans are: Anand, Bhasin, Chadha, Kohli,Sabharwal, Sahni, Sethi and Suri. Later four new subclans originated those were Chandok (Chandhoke, Chandhok, Chandiok), Chhachi (Chachi, Chhachhi): a sub section of the Kohli clan, and Ghai.                                                                                                                                                               The Khukhrain Biradari was founded by the far sighted fief (small kingdom) Raja Khokhar Anand in the 12th Century some 900 years ago. During this period the area of Khokhar(in ancient times known as Indus Valley) was ravaged by Islamic raiders and warlords who were constantly targeting these small peaceful Hindu kingdoms of this region. Raja Anand saw a need for defensive measure against these Islamic warlords who lived by violence and plunder. He married his daughter princess Anand into Sahni family instigating the system of Endogamy - meaning by birth and marriage. Soon there emerged a brotherhood of Eight clans who were related to each other by births and marriages called Khukhrain Biradari. Later Khukhrains setteled en force at Bhera. Bhera became known as city of Khukhrains. The Eight Arayan clans were Anand, Sahni (Sahaney/Sawhney), Suri, Chadha, Sabarwal, Kohli, Bhasin and Sethi. The brotherhood flourished with aims to defend the Hindu faith - property - women and to aid each other in time of need. 
   
                The history of Khukhrains / Khukhrains was almost silent before 490 BC.
               The king Kushrain of Bhera was succeeded in 490 BC by his eight sons, DHAN ANAND (thus Anand), KUAL HARI (thus Kohli), SHOOR SEN (thus Suri), BHUSEEN (thus Bhasin), SHESH SHAINI (thus Sahni), CHAMUNDE (thus Chadha), SERATH RAJ (thus Sethi) and the youngest one SHUBHARWAR (thus Sabharwal).
  All these eight sons Kushrain ruled north-west India, currently Punjab and the area of present Pakistan. All the present eight surnames of Khukhrains were named after these eight kings.
