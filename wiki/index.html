 <p>The history of wadhwa/wadwani was a bit difficult to find but as we know they lived in sindh and punjab region of present day pakistan we will have to see first see the history of these places the last dynasty which ruled over this region was the <b>Ror Dynasty</b> (450-489 AD) which means that wadhwa's were a clan of the arora. and they were Shikapuris
 <p>The Shikapuris were renowned merchants and well known for their banking and business acumen are considered to be descendants of these people. Some of them were Sikhs and others were influenced by the Sikh religion. As this migration happened before the establishment of Khalsa Panth in 1699, this may explain the 'non Khalsa' but Sikh tenants of Sindhis.</p> </p>

<p>after the british rule ended they had to shifted to diffrent part of india,afganistan and pakistan. </p>

<h2>Raja Dahir Ror Kumar</h2>
<p>Raja Dahir (Sindhi pronunciation: [rɑːɟɑː ɗɑːɦirə]; Raja Dahir; 663 – 712 CE) was the last Hindu Pushkarna brahmin[1] [2]ruler of Sindh in the western region of the Indian subcontinent.[3] In 711 CE his kingdom was invaded by the Ummayad Caliphate led by Muhammad bin Qasim where Dahir died while defending his kingdom. According to the Chachnama, the Umayyad campaign against Arori Raja Dahir was due to a pirate raid off the coast of the Sindhi coast that resulted in gifts to the Ummayad caliph from the king of Serendib being stolen.[4][5]

  <p>He was killed at the Battle of Aror which took place between his dynasty and the Arabs at the banks of the Indus River, near modern-day Nawabshah at the hands of the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim. His body was then decapitated and his head was sent to the governor of Basra, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. His headless body was then cremated by his own soldiers[citation needed]. 
  Sindh in 700 CE, under the Raja's dynasty. The Umayyad Caliphate can be seen advancing upon the western frontier of the Indian subcontinent.His family is still unknown.
  Reign in the Chach Nama</p>
The Chach Nama is the oldest chronicles of the Arab conquest of Sindh. It was translated in Persian by an Arab named Muhammad Ali bin Hamid bin Abu Bakr Kufi in 1216 CE[6] from an earlier Arabic text believed to have been written by the Thaqafi family (relatives of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi).

<p>War with the Umayyads.
  Throughout his reign, Maharaja Dahir had to face invasions from Ummayad Caliphate which had grown quite powerful by that time.
  
  According to Chachnama and the Arab historian Biladhuri, Dahir defeated the Arabs twice in pitched battles during the Twin battles of Debal in which, the invading Arab commanders Ubaidullah and Budail or Bazil were killed by Sindhis under Dahir's son Jaisiah.[7][8]
  
  Jaisiah later appointed his own chief or Thakur who governed the place on his behalf. According to Chachnamah ,when the news of Bazil's death was relayed to Hajjaj, he became very sad and full of rage.
  
  Thus leading to the fateful expedition of Qasim. Before the battle of Aror, Maharaja Dahir is said to have given this speech as per Chachnama[9]
  
  
  "I am going to meet the Arabs in open battle, and fight them as best as I can. If I crush them, my kingdom will then be put on a firm footing. But if I am killed honourably, the event will be recorded in the books of Arabia and India and will be talked about by great men. It will be heard by other kings in the world, and it will be said that Raja Dahir of Sindh sacrificed his precious life for the sake of his country, in fighting with the enemy."[10]
  
  The primary reason cited in the Chach Nama for the expedition by the governor of Basra, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, against Raja Dahir, was a pirate raid off the coast of Debal resulting in gifts to the caliph from the king of Serendib (modern Sri Lanka) being stolen.[11] Meds (a tribe of Scythians living in Sindh) also known as Bawarij had pirated upon Sassanid shipping in the past, from the mouth of the Tigris to the Sri Lankan coast, and now they were able to prey on Arab shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar.
  

  
  By enlisting the support of local tribes such as the Meds and also the support of the Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories which were added into the Umayyad Caliphate.[12]
  
  Sometime before the final battle, Dahir's vizier approached him and suggested that Dahir should take refuge with one of the friendly kings of India. "You should say to them, 'I am a wall between you and the Arab army. If I fall, nothing will stop your destruction at their hands.'" If that wasn't acceptable to Dahir, said the vizier, then he should at least send away his family to some safe point in India. Dahir refused to do either. "I cannot send away my family to security while the families of my thakurs and nobles remain here."[12]
  
  Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed the river and defeated his forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 711, eventually killing him. After Dahir was killed in the Battle of Aror on the banks of the River Indus, his head was cut off from his body and sent to Hajjaj bin Yousuf.</p>
